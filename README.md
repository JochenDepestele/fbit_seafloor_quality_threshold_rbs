# fbit_seafloor_quality_threshold_rbs
In 2025 the EU requested for a technical service for data collection and preparation to support seafloor quality threshold analysis (https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.30417964). The data call is available at the ICES library: https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.29559482. This repo is focused on supporting analyses for the RBS indicator.
